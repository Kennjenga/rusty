# Linked List Explanation

## Node Class
The `Node` class represents a single element in a linked list. Each node contains two attributes:

1. `data`: Stores the value of the node.
2. `next`: A reference to the next node in the linked list. It is initialized to `None` by default, indicating the end of the list.

### Code:
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

## LinkedList Class
The `LinkedList` class is a container for managing a sequence of `Node` objects. It provides methods to manipulate the linked list, such as adding, removing, or traversing nodes. The implementation of this class is currently incomplete in the provided code.

### Code:
```python
class LinkedList:
    # Implementation to be added
    pass
```

## Key Features of Linked Lists
1. **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a predefined size and can grow or shrink dynamically.
2. **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Adding or removing elements is efficient, especially at the beginning or middle of the list, as it does not require shifting elements.
3. **Sequential Access**: Elements are accessed sequentially, starting from the head node.

## Types of Linked Lists
1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to `None`.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has pointers to both the next and the previous nodes.
3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

## Applications of Linked Lists
1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Used when the size of the data structure is not known in advance.
2. **Implementation of Other Data Structures**: Stacks, queues, and adjacency lists for graphs.
3. **Undo Mechanisms**: Used in applications like text editors to maintain a history of states.
4. **Operating Systems**: Process scheduling and memory management.

## Example Usage
Here is an example of how to create and use a linked list:

```python
# Create nodes
node1 = Node(10)
node2 = Node(20)
node3 = Node(30)

# Link nodes
node1.next = node2
node2.next = node3

# Traverse the linked list
current = node1
while current:
    print(current.data)
    current = current.next
```

This will output:
```
10
20
30
```
