# Popular Linked List Questions

## Basic Questions
1. **What is a linked list?**
   - Explain the concept, types (singly, doubly, circular), and differences from arrays.
   answer: 

2. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of linked lists?**
   - Discuss dynamic size, efficient insertions/deletions, and drawbacks like sequential access and memory overhead.

3. **What are the types of linked lists?**
   - Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list.

4. **How do you traverse a linked list?**
   - Explain how to iterate through nodes starting from the head.

## Implementation Questions
5. **How do you insert a node at the beginning, middle, or end of a linked list?**
   - Write code to handle these cases.

6. **How do you delete a node from a linked list?**
   - Handle deletion by value, position, or at the head/tail.

7. **How do you reverse a linked list?**
   - Reverse the pointers of the nodes iteratively or recursively.

8. **How do you find the length of a linked list?**
   - Count the nodes while traversing the list.

9. **How do you detect a cycle in a linked list?**
   - Use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).

10. **How do you merge two sorted linked lists?**
    - Merge them into a single sorted list.

## Advanced Questions
11. **How do you find the middle of a linked list?**
    - Use two pointers (slow and fast) to find the middle node.

12. **How do you find the nth node from the end of a linked list?**
    - Use two pointers with a gap of `n` nodes.

13. **How do you check if two linked lists intersect?**
    - Find the intersection point using length difference or hashing.

14. **How do you remove duplicates from a linked list?**
    - Use a hash set for unsorted lists or compare adjacent nodes for sorted lists.

15. **How do you implement a stack or queue using a linked list?**
    - Use a linked list to implement these data structures.

## Conceptual Questions
16. **What is the difference between a linked list and an array?**
    - Discuss memory allocation, access time, and use cases.

17. **What is the time complexity of common linked list operations?**
    - Explain complexities for insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

18. **What are the real-world applications of linked lists?**
    - Discuss use cases like dynamic memory allocation, undo functionality, and adjacency lists in graphs.

19. **How do you convert a linked list to a binary tree?**
    - Explain the process of creating a binary tree from a linked list.

20. **What are the challenges of implementing a linked list in low-level languages like C?**
    - Discuss manual memory management and pointer handling.
